# gwaR
A collection of R functions to conduct downstream GWAS analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana.
The idea is to provide functions to quickly and effectively identify SNPs that are actually impactful (in addition to a low p) on the original phenotype data. 
Provides ways to analyze linkage around a SNP, to quickly identify linked SNPs that have a strong impact.
This package strongly depends on the 1001genomes API and will break once anythign changes there.
