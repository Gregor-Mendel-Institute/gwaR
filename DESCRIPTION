Description: The 'gwaR' package is a collection of convenience functions to plot, inspect and analyse GWAS
    results typically obtained from limix. It uses local SNPmatrices or the REST APIs from <http://tools.1001genomes.org/api/index.html>
    to obtain annotations for SNPs and genes as well as gene expression data and is currently only useful for
    Arabidopsis thaliana.
